# Welcome to the Zenith Wiki!

We're an **engineering group** linked to the **University of São Paulo(USP)** based in São Carlos,SP (Brazil).


**Zenith Aerospace** was created in 2014, with the goal to bring technology, aerospace engineering and students **closer together**.


Using **Metheorological Balloons** we can bring **Stratospheric Probes** up to a height of **30km** (around 18.6 miles), exposing them to an **external environment**, allowing us to **test and prototipe** systems that may be **launched into deeper space** someday.


**In this wiki you can learn more about the projects our departments have been working on.**
## Some of our achievements
> - **1st Place** - Cubedesign (INPE,2018)
> - **3rd Place** - Global Space Balloon Challenge ("Best Design" Category, 2018)
> - **Featured Project** at Campus Party (2018)
> - **Featured Project** at Campus Party (2017)
> - **2nd Place** - Global Space Balloon Challenge ("Best Experiment" Category, 2016)
