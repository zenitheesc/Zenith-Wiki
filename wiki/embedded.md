# Embedded Systems Department
The Embedded Systems Department has the objective of researching and developing technologies related to aerospacial applications within the scope of Zenith Aerospace's interests.
The department is divided in subgroups, each one with specific development goals that can be assembled together to achieve the final embedded systems used in Zenith's proejcts, for example: Probe Control Boards, Telecomunication Boards, Power Boards, Control Softwares and U.Is to allow interaction between the user and the system.
